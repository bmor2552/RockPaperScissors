# Rock Paper Scissors
**Objective: Complete Free Code Camp Challenge In Order To Practice Machine Learning Using Python**  
# The Challenge 
*Create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.*
# The Process
Free code camp was able to provide the body of code needed to complete this challenge. My task is to update the code for the game to work properly. There are several functions in this body of code that make up the game. The approach is to first gain an understanding of the code that was provided, piece by piece. Once I have an understanding of how the game works, I will then be able to update the body of code.
